## **Project Overview**

_This interactive data visualization project displays a dataset of adoptable animals using bar and pie charts. The data is locally generated to simulate a real-world shelter system, and includes animal type, age, and adoption status. Users can filter, sort, and switch views to explore the dataset visually._

## **Features**

_Filter by Animal Type
Dropdown menu lets users view only dogs, cats, birds, etc.

Sort by Age
Select to sort animals by ascending or descending age.

Toggle View: Bar ↔ Pie Chart
Switch between bar chart (based on age) and pie chart (by animal type count)._

## **Technologies Used**

_D3.js – data-driven chart rendering (SVG-based)

Node.js – backend runtime

Express.js – server framework

Handlebars (hbs) – HTML templating

Custom dataset – generated using a Node script

CSS – minimal styling for clean UI._

## **Future Enhancements**

_Show real shelter names and boroughs

Filter by status (e.g., only show Available pets)

Add images for each animal

Animate chart transitions more smoothly

Add search bar to look up pet by name._

## **Credits**

_List any third-party assets used in the project (e.g., sound effects, images, fonts) and provide proper attribution. Acknowledge any resources, tutorials, or references you used to help complete the project._
